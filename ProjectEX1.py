#EXAMPLE #1: 

#Below, I am assigning the user input to the question: "What is your name?" to the variable 'name'.
#Now, the variable name will be equal to the answer of the user to the question (the input).
name = input("What is your name \n")
#Below, the program prints: "Your name is: ", and then the user input, or the name of the individual.
#So, if your name is Sam, the program prints: "Your name is: Sam". 
print("Your name is: " + name)
